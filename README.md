Time Series Forecasting with FbProphet
Overview
This project focuses on time series forecasting using FbProphet, a powerful tool for predicting future trends. The dataset used contains airline passenger data, and the goal is to develop an accurate forecasting model.

Project Structure
1. Introduction

Brief overview of the project and its objectives.
2. Setup

Instructions for installing necessary dependencies (pystan, fbprophet) using pip and conda.
3. Data Exploration

Initial exploration of the dataset, visualizing trends, and ensuring data integrity.
4. Data Preprocessing

Cleaning and preprocessing steps, including handling missing values and adjusting column names.
5. Model Development

Initialization of FbProphet model, training on historical data, and optimizing for accurate projections.
6. Future Projections

Creating future date projections for 365 days using the trained model.
7. Results Visualization

Visualizing predicted projections and model components.
8. Time Series Analysis

Insights and analysis focused on the years 1960-1962.
9. Cross-Validation

Conducting cross-validation to assess model performance over different time periods.
10. Performance Metrics

Evaluation of model performance using metrics such as root mean squared error (RMSE).
11. Visualizations

Additional visualizations for better understanding and interpretation of results.
